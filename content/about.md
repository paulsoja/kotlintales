Hi! 👋 I'm Pavlo, an Android developer who enjoys writing Kotlin a bit too much.

I’ve been building mobile apps for several years, mostly with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **clean architecture**.  
Over time I noticed that the most valuable lessons on a project rarely come from “perfect” examples — they come from **weird bugs, ugly legacy code, and design decisions that went wrong**.

This is why this blog is called **Kotlin Tales**.

Each post is a small “tale” from real projects:

- refactoring messy features into composable functions and clear architecture;
- using types, value classes and sealed hierarchies to make illegal states unrepresentable;
- making Android apps more testable and predictable with functional-style approaches;
- dealing with navigation, state, flows, error handling, DI and other “everyday” problems;
- balancing “just ship it” with good design and maintainability.

I don’t try to invent new patterns here.  
Instead, I try to **tell honest stories**:

- what the problem was,
- what trade-offs we had,
- what solution we chose,
- and what I’d do differently next time.

If you’re an Android/Kotlin developer who likes to think about **design, readability and long-term code health**, I hope these tales will be useful for you — and maybe even save you from a couple of bugs.

Thanks for reading, and welcome to Kotlin Tales 🐾
